Q1:
get from instructions on line 24:
  24:	4635                	li	a2,13
as we can see that the 13 is loaded to the a2 register.

Q2:
i think that may be the instructions bellow:
  1c:	1141                	addi	sp,sp,-16
  1e:	e406                	sd	ra,8(sp)
  20:	e022                	sd	s0,0(sp)
  22:	0800                	addi	s0,sp,16
the 1c:1141 instruction line make the stack prepration for 
the function call for f function and function g, but we cannot
find a jr instruction may be the compiler has done some optimize for us.

Q3:
after all the parameters has been calculated, printf function is called,
use some instruction called jalr to the function's address:
  34:	612080e7          	jalr	1554(ra) # 642 <printf>
so the address of the function printf is located at the address of (ra) plus 1554
you can search the whole asm file to find the first instruction of the printf at:

void
printf(const char *fmt, ...)
{
 642:	711d                	addi	sp,sp,-96
 644:	ec06                	sd	ra,24(sp)
 646:	e822                	sd	s0,16(sp)
 648:	1000                	addi	s0,sp,32
 64a:	e40c                	sd	a1,8(s0)
 64c:	e810                	sd	a2,16(s0)
 64e:	ec14                	sd	a3,24(s0)
 650:	f018                	sd	a4,32(s0)
 652:	f41c                	sd	a5,40(s0)
 654:	03043823          	sd	a6,48(s0)
 658:	03143c23          	sd	a7,56(s0)
}

Q4:
i guess the value could be the sp + 24 as we can see in the function above,
or the ra value still remain the value before jump to the printf function's
first instruction.

Q5:
the out put is he110 World, the hexcimal of the number is 0xe110,
whose bits pattern is 1110 0001 0001 0000, and the highest bits are 
at the lowest address, if we are using the big-endian we should put the highest bits
at the highest address.


Q6:
as we have seen that the printf function pass parameters through
register, since we have pass the first argument's value, so the value
is dependened on what has been there in the register, in our example above,
is the a2 register's value that determine the print result of the y= .
