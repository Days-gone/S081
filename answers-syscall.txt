it's usertrap() function in kernel/trap.c:67
2
finish the line of the num = p->trapframe->a7
using p num gdb command
got the answer 7, which represents the macro number of the sys_exec
3
sstatus value is 0x22, 
asking the gpt got the explanation that the bit0 is 1 means:
looking into the doc of the risc-v mannual, found out that 0x22 bit-pattern
means SIE is on, and SPIE is on, we can got the info on the page 64 of the doc:
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/download/Priv-v1.12/riscv-privileged-20211203.pdf.
the context is like bellow:
The SIE bit enables or disables all interrupts in supervisor mode. When SIE is clear, interrupts
are not taken while in supervisor mode. When the hart is running in user-mode, the value in
SIE is ignored, and supervisor-level interrupts are enabled. The supervisor can disable individual
interrupt sources using the sie CSR.
The SPIE bit indicates whether supervisor interrupts were enabled prior to trapping into supervisor
mode. When a trap is taken into supervisor mode, SPIE is set to SIE, and SIE is set to 0. When
an SRET instruction is executed, SIE is set to SPIE, then SPIE is set to 1.

80002052:	00002683          	lw	a3,0(zero) # 0 <_entry-0x80000000>
means load the value at 0(zero), to the register of a3, so num is in the a3 register.
5
scause is 0x0d, look the table in the 71 page of the doc, the cause is:
load page fault
cause the physical address 0 is unused in the xv6 kernel, so it caused a load page fault error.
you can see the hint on the figure3.3 of the riscv-xv6 book which is the reading material.
6
the process which caused kernel panic is initcode, and its pid is 1
